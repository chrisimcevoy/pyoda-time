# Pyoda Time

Pyoda Time is an alternative date and time API for Python. 

It helps you to think about your data more clearly, and express operations on that data more precisely.

This project is a Python port of [Noda Time](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime), an alternative DateTime library for .NET (which in turn was inspired by [Joda Time](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time)).

## Installation

```commandline
pip install pyoda-time
```

## Quick Start

Coming soon...

## Documentation

## Project Status

Pyoda Time is currently in the pre-alpha stage, with fundamental logic and features being actively developed. 

The project goal is to provide a powerful alternative for time management in Python, drawing inspiration from the strengths of Noda Time and adapting them to a Pythonic API.

## Contributions

Contributions of all kinds are welcome.
