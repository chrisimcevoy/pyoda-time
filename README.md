# Pyoda Time

Pyoda Time is an alternative date and time API for Python. 

It helps you to think about your data more clearly, and express operations on that data more precisely.

This project is a Python port of [Noda Time](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime), an alternative DateTime library for .NET (which in turn was inspired by [Joda Time](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time)).

## Installation

```commandline
pip install pyoda-time
```

## Quick Start

Coming soon!

In the meantime, [view the docs](https://pyodatime.org/).

## Project Status

Pyoda Time is currently in the pre-alpha stage, with fundamental logic and features being actively developed. 

The project goal is to provide a powerful alternative for time management in Python, drawing inspiration from the strengths of Noda Time and adapting them to a Pythonic API.

## Contributions

Contributions of all kinds are welcome.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please refer to the [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Acknowledgements

We express our gratitude to the authors and contributors of Noda Time and Joda Time for their pioneering work in the field of date and time management. Pyoda Time aspires to continue this tradition within the Python ecosystem.
