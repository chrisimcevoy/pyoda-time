        Each mapping consists of a single Windows time zone ID and a single territory to potentially multiple TZDB IDs
        that are broadly equivalent to that Windows zone/territory pair.

        Mappings for a single Windows system time zone can appear multiple times in this list, in different territories.
        For example, "Central Standard Time" maps to different TZDB zones in different countries (the US, Canada,
        Mexico) and even within a single territory there can be multiple zones. Every Windows system time zone covered
        within this collection has a "primary" entry with a territory code of "001" (which is the value of
        ``MapZone.PRIMARY_TERRITORY``) and a single corresponding TZDB zone.

        This collection is not guaranteed to cover every Windows time zone. Some zones may be unmappable (such as
        "Mid-Atlantic Standard Time") and there can be a delay between a new Windows time zone being introduced and it
        appearing in CLDR, ready to be used by Noda Time. (There's also bound to be a delay between it appearing in
        CLDR and being used in your production system.) In practice however, you're unlikely to wish to use a time zone
        which isn't covered here.
