class IDateTimeZoneSource(Protocol):
    """Provides the interface for objects that can retrieve time zone definitions given an ID.

    The interface presumes that the available time zones are static; there is no mechanism for
    updating the list of available time zones. Any time zone ID that is returned in ``get_ids``
    must be resolved by ``for_id`` for the life of the source.

    Implementations need not cache time zones or the available time zone IDs.
    Caching is typically provided by ``DateTimeZoneCache``, which most consumers should use instead of
    consuming ``IDateTimeZoneSource`` directly in order to get better performance.

    It is expected that any exceptions thrown are implementation-specific; nothing is explicitly
    specified in the interface. Typically this would be unusual to the point that callers would not
    try to catch them; any implementation which may break in ways that are sensible to catch should advertise
    this clearly, so that clients will know to handle the exceptions appropriately. No wrapper exception
    type is provided by Pyoda Time to handle this situation, and code in Pyoda Time does not try to catch
    such exceptions.

        should not contain duplicates: this is not enforced, and while it may not have a significant impact on
        clients in some cases, it is generally unfriendly.  The built-in implementations never return duplicates.

        The source is not required to provide the IDs in any particular order, although they should be distinct.
