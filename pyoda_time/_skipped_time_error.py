class SkippedTimeError(ValueError):
    """Exception thrown to indicate that the specified local time doesn't exist in a particular time zone due to
    daylight saving time changes.

    This normally occurs for spring transitions, where the clock goes forward (usually by an hour). For example,
    suppose the time zone goes forward at 2am, so the second after 01:59:59 becomes 03:00:00. In that case, local times
    such as 02:30:00 never occur.

    This exception is used to indicate such problems, as they're usually not the same as other ``ValueError`` causes,
    such as entering "15" for a month number.

    Note that it is possible (though extremely rare) for a whole day to be skipped due to a time zone transition, so
    this exception may also be thrown in cases where no local time is valid for a particular local date. (For example,
    Samoa skipped December 30th 2011 entirely, transitioning from UTC-10 to UTC+14 at midnight.)
