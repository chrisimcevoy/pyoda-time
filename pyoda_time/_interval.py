    Equality is defined in a component-wise fashion: two intervals are considered equal if their start instants are
    equal to each other and their end instants are equal to each other. Ordering between intervals is not defined.

    The interval includes the start instant and excludes the end instant. However, an interval
    may be missing its start or end, in which case the interval is deemed to be infinite in that
    direction.
