    """Represents an annual date (month and day) in the ISO calendar but without a specific year, typically for
    recurrent events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and deadlines.

    Equality and comparison order are defined in the natural way. Two values are equal if they represent the same month
    and the same day-of-month. One value is earlier than another if it has a smaller month, or the same month but an
    earlier day-of-month.

    In the future, this class may be expanded to support other calendar systems, but this does not generalize terribly
    cleanly, particularly to the Hebrew calendar system with its leap month.
